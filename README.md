# PortfolioProject
Started working on my web development skills.  Learning HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and Flask with this project.

My priority is to 1) get a blog up and running on my site. I'll 
use this to learn how to incorporate SQLite with Flask and possibly user
authentication, 2) write my biography and finish my 'About' section, and 
3) work on my project section to gear up for Fall recruitment.
